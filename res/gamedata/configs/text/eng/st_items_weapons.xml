		<text>The most common pistol in the zone, a legacy of the Soviet era, PM is one of the best representatives of the class of compact self-defense weapons. It is small in size, extremely reliable, easy to use and maintain.

		<text>A relatively new assault rifle that has quickly found admirers around the world, despite lacking a 'trendy' design. Weapons of this series are one of the best in their class, renowned for their reliability, accuracy, and ease of use.

		<text>HK USP</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_usp_descr">
		<text>Impeccable reliability and durability combined with excellent accuracy are the main noteworthy features of this weapon.

	</string>	
	<string id="st_wpn_abakan_descr">
		<text>A modern assault rifle developed as a replacement for the ageing AKM 74/2. The main difference is its high speed 2-round burst firing mode, which allows two bullets to be fired at exactly the same spot on a target up to 100 metres away. This significantly increases the likelihood of hitting the target in comparison to the 1 round firing mode, which considerably improves kill potential, stopping power, and armour piercing capability.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_ak74_descr">
		<text>This weapon, designed in 1974, signalled the adoption of small calibre and low impulse rounds by Warsaw Pact countries. A descendant of the most popular assault rifle in the world, the AKM-74/2 has an even bigger muzzle brake, resulting in a reduction of what was already manageable recoil. This facilitates better accuracy and groupings, especially when fired in fast single shots or bursts. As before, the rifle is very simple and reliable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_ak74u_descr">
		<text>Despite being similar to submachine guns in size, weight, and tactical purpose, this weapon is classified as an assault rifle due to the fact that its internal mechanism is identical to that of the AKM 74/2. The weapon is notable for its mobility in close quarters and high armour-penetration capacity, while its drawbacks are its short effective range, despite the relatively long bullet range, a tendency to overheat and high ricochet propensity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_colt1911_descr">
		<text>An improved version of a classic automatic pistol, which passed all the major armed conflicts of the 20th century with flying colours and entered the new millennium with confidence. Produced by dozens if not hundreds of arms manufacturers around the world in both standard and modified configurations. The weapon's only drawback, its mediocre magazine capacity, is largely compensated by the hard-hitting ammo it uses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_desert_eagle_descr">
		<text>The ultimate hand cannon: bulky, heavy, and highly lethal. Developed as a specialised weapon for hunting medium-sized and large game, as well as for shooting competitions involving firing at steel body targets at distances over 50 metres. Its limited use in the Zone can be attributed to its price, size and weight, which are all double those of other pistols.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_fort_descr">
		<text>A Ukrainian-made pistol predominantly used by law enforcement organisations. Provides higher accuracy, better ergonomics, and a larger magazine capacity than the PMm. These pistols make it into the Zone in large numbers thanks to the sale of defective weapons, which suffer from technical miscalculations in early design models. Despite this, the pistol is in demand among stalkers thanks to its good combat characteristics.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_mine_descr">
		<text>The PFM-1 is an anti-personnel mine with an infamous reputation for being the cause of large amounts of civilian casualties. Often referred to as a 'butterfly' mine due to its unusual shape.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_pm_descr">
		<text>This Soviet legacy is the most common pistol in the Zone and is one of the best compact self-defence handguns available. It is small, highly reliable, easy to use and maintain in working order. It also suffers from several drawbacks, including its short range, low firing accuracy, and poor stopping power, while also losing out to modern pistols in its class in terms of weight and magazine size.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_protecta_descr">
		<text>A smoothbore combat revolver-type shotgun intended to provide extreme firepower for militarised units. The weapon benefits from a large magazine and a high effective rate of fire, but its bulkiness and considerable weight, combined with a long reload time, are the price to be paid for these advantages. Rare in the Zone and is used primarily to clear closed spaces of mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_rpg7_descr">
		<text>This grenade launcher from the 1960s made its way into the Zone from army depots. The weapon is a smoothbore single-shot recoilless launch system with an open-rear tube. Comes with a PGO-7 x2.7 optical scope. Although its huge size and weight make it an unlikely choice for stalkers, it has found admirers in the Zone given its huge destructive power and ease of use.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_sig220_descr">
		<text>The only remaining mass produced model of a globally renowned pistol, this weapon has earned a reputation for its excellent ergonomics and accuracy, and while its magazine is relatively small, it benefits from powerful ammo and a mechanism that functions like a Swiss watch. Some believe the SIP-t M200 to be the best mass produced .45 ACP calibre handgun there is, and it has certainly got a following among experienced stalkers and mercenaries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_svu_descr">
		<text>A modernised version of the SVDm-2 sniper rifle in a compact bullpup design made on the order of rapid response forces. It allows faster precision fire and is considerably lighter, while its single shot firing accuracy at short and medium range is similar to that of its predecessor. These qualities have earned it the admiration of countless stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_gauss_descr">
		<text>A super-accurate hi-tech weapon known as item 62, this rifle was developed in secret laboratories located inside the Zone. The weapon operates by accelerating bullets to extremely high speeds using a system of electromagnets, which provides incredible stopping power with virtually no recoil. The weapon is powered by using encapsulated artefact fragments in the batteries.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_beretta_descr">
		<text>Martha pistols enjoy the reputation of a relatively reliable, albeit somewhat cumbersome weapon, around the world. In service with armed forces and police across the ocean, as well as various military and law enforcement organisations worldwide. The pistol is equally popular with members of the underworld, thanks to its powerful round and magazine capacity. Marthas found in the Zone are usually dated, probably from retired stock.</text>
